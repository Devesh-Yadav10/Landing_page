    <h1>Story of my Life</h1>
    <div><p>Hey! welcome here,</p>
        <p>If you're reading this, probably you've visited on of my websites. Hope you liked my work and any suggestions are really appreciated. You can contact me at the given info on my sites.</p>
        <p>I was born in a middle class family and I am very shy talking to girls mainly (for real..). I am pretty good at learning stuff quickly. I do play alot of games too.</p>
        <p>I'm currently (As of 2024), a 18 year old boy from India. I've sutdied python before in my school which gave me the required foundation for web development. Little after that I got out of my school and started preparing for college and now I've got one and I'm going to study computer science there so I used TOP (The Odin Project) as a side hustle because I was so bored. These things doesn't matter at all, I'm just happy for whatever I've gained over this time and all thanks to TOP and the helpful community for always being there for help.</p>
        <p>I'm always eager to help others so feel free to contact me whenever needed, I'll try my best to reply as quick as possible. One thing that kept me going through this was my belief that, "Whatever's gonna happen will be good for me", and this will be my motivation for future.</p>
        <p>I hope I didn't bored you.</p>
        <p class="diffalign">Enjoy your day. <em>Life is too short to enjoy ..</em></p>
        <p class="diffalign">Peace out !</p>
